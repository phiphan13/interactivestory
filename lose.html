			Filled with rage, you made a fatal mistake. <br> You were caught, not knowing soon you'd meet the other yordles. </br> With you being caught, it warned the giants of others who may interfere. <br>With his might, Dr. Mundo, the leader of the giant group, took down the remaining yordles. </br> And. It's. All. Your. Fault.
			<br>The End.</br>
