			At last, you stood against the giants. There you met other fellow yordle heroes who were attacked by the giants. <br>The lot of you combined your strengths and took down the giant, Dr.Mundo. </br>After a long battle, you learned that you only defeated one of the big giants. <br>Dr. Mundo threatened that all the yordles will soon come to an end as he falls. </br>The yordles learned they must prepare for the worst. But for now, they celebrate their victory!
