			Under a great wizard's (Merlin) guide, this little wizard sought to become a magic knight. When the giants reigned, they stormed their castle and took Merlin into captive. The little wizard tried his best to fight and eagerly get Merlin back, but failed. Beaten and furious, the little wizard ran into Merlin's cabinet. In the cabinet, he bestowed upon a glove that was drowned in green magical aura. The green aura begin to flow into the little wizard as he wore the glove, giving him ancient magic power. With this new found power, he pledged to save his master.
