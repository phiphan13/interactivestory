			A legend among the yordles, this badger..? rat..? ratdog..? soldier, was training young yordle scouts. The soldier begin to let his young scouts go on their first mission without him to test their basic skills. As the time past, the soldier noticed the sky turning red as the smell of burning wood fill the air. Worried about his scouts, the soldier rushed into the forest. He heard a scout's whistle and begin to approach swiftly. As he approach, tremors begins to flow through his body as he see his scouts fallen against the giants' might. Geared with vegence, the soldier vowed for revenge.
